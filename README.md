# Computing-Large-Deviation-Functionals-under-constraints

In this repository, there are the C-scripts we use to compute the large deviation functions in "On Magnetic Models in Wavefunction Ensembles", published in [Entropy 2023, 25, 564](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/4/564) covering theorem 3.

The corresponding preprint version "On Schr√∂dingerist Quantum Thermodynamics" is available on [arXiv:2208.07688](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07688), where this is referred to as theorem 2.
